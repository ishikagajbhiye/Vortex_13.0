## Previous Year Questions (PYQs)

This section contains selected previous-year problems shared for **practice and reference**.  
These are intended to help participants understand the **style, depth, and thinking process**
expected in Codathon, rather than to serve as exhaustive preparation material.

### Credits

The problems included here were designed and curated by our previous year Event Heads:

- **Karthik**
- **Renesh**

All credit for the problem design, structure, and ideas belongs entirely to them.
These problems are shared here with appreciation for the thought and effort that went
into creating meaningful and engaging challenges.

### Acknowledgement

A special mention to **Round 2 – Question 2**, which stands out for its clarity and depth and we enjoyed it the most.
The conceptual inspiration for this problem draws from the following talk:

- *[Projectile Motion (WITH AIR FRICTION)](https://youtu.be/b9S_L1AaJNw)*

### Closing Note
We want to build on the philosophy established by earlier Event Heads, especially Karthik, and seek to carry that legacy forward this year as well.
