# Codathon – Round 1  
## Purpose and Assessment Objective

This round is designed to evaluate foundational problem-solving ability through computational and logical tasks.

The objective is to observe how participants interpret a problem, structure their reasoning, and translate that understanding into clear, consistent steps or code. Emphasis is placed on thought process, decision-making, and correctness under simple constraints, rather than on specialized knowledge, speed, or familiarity with specific tools.


## 1. Computational Literacy

Participants are expected to be comfortable treating computation as a **tool for reasoning**, not merely execution.

This includes:
- Representing information in different forms (numerical, symbolic, encoded, discrete)
- Understanding how information changes under simple operations
- Reasoning about bit-level, digit-level, or representation-level behavior when required
- Translating verbal or contextual constraints into computable steps

A key skill being tested is the ability to:
- Read a problem carefully
- Extract what is relevant
- Ignore narrative or contextual noise
- Translate real-world or story-based descriptions into structured reasoning

Participants are expected to make **reasonable assumptions** where needed and remain consistent with them.\
Problems may allow multiple valid computational paths; no single method is assumed.

## 2. Logical Reasoning & Structure

Round 1 emphasizes the ability to:
- Identify patterns, invariants, and constraints
- Follow cause–effect relationships across steps
- Distinguish between necessary and incidental conditions
- Reason through sequences, conditions, and state changes

This may involve:
- Sequential logic
- Conditional behavior
- Elimination-based reasoning
- Identifying constraints and dependencies
- Consistency checks across multiple conditions

The focus is on **clarity of reasoning**, not speed.

## 3. Mathematical Maturity (Broad Sense)

The mathematical component is **intentionally broad** and non-specialized.

It may draw from:
- Discrete reasoning
- Elementary properties of numbers and relationships
- Modular or cyclical behavior
- Growth, accumulation, or iteration
- Counting under constraints
- Stability or long-term behavior of simple processes

This coverage is meant to span **most foundational numerical thinking**, rather than any narrow sub-area.\
No advanced formalism is assumed; insight and careful reasoning matter more than formula recall.

## 4. Algorithmic Thinking

Participants should be able to:
- Break a problem into manageable steps
- Decide an order of operations
- Handle edge cases and special conditions
- Thinking procedurally rather than heuristically

Any clear, correct, and well-structured approach is valid.

---

## 5. Coding Fundamentals (Language-Agnostic)

Where programming is involved, the expectations are intentionally minimal but essential.

This includes comfort with:
- Variables and basic data handling
- Loops and repetition
- Conditional logic
- Simple functions or reusable blocks
- Reading and interpreting given code
- Modifying or improving an existing procedure

The emphasis is on **how you think through code**, not language-specific features.

---

## 6. What Is *Not* Being Tested

Round 1 does **not** aim to test:
- Memorization of niche formulas
- Knowledge of specialized domains
- Tool-specific tricks
- Speed typing or syntactic cleverness

The focus remains firmly on **fundamentals that generalize across problems**.

---

## Closing Note

Round 1 is designed to cover a **wide surface area of foundational thinking**  
so that participants are not constrained by narrow definitions of “syllabus”.

If you are comfortable reasoning carefully, translating ideas into steps,  
and thinking computationally at a basic level,  
you are within scope.
