# Codathon – Round 2  
## Purpose, Scope, and Assessment Objective

Round 2 is intended to evaluate a participant’s ability to engage with **larger, open-ended problems** that require sustained reasoning, focus, and structured decision-making over extended durations.

The objective is to assess how participants model systems, make assumptions explicit, choose abstractions, and maintain coherence while navigating complexity, uncertainty, and competing constraints.

This round also evaluates the ability to sustain attention and logical continuity across problems that cannot be resolved through short or isolated steps.

All concepts, definitions, and context required to solve the problems
**will be provided during the round**.\
Participants are not expected to arrive with prior domain-specific preparation.

## 1. Problem Structuring, Modeling, and Strategy

Participants are expected to demonstrate the ability to:
- Interpret complex or narrative problem statements and extract the governing structure
- Translate physical, logical, or contextual descriptions into workable models
- Identify relevant variables, constraints, interactions, and boundaries
- Decide what can be simplified, approximated, or ignored without breaking validity
- Build and adapt a plan of attack rather than executing a fixed recipe

Problems are designed such that **modeling choices meaningfully affect outcomes**.

## 2. Mathematical, Computational, and Engineering Reasoning

The scope of reasoning may broadly involve ideas commonly encountered across engineering and scientific domains, including but not limited to:
- Balance-based thinking (material, energy, information, or state)
- Finite, discrete, or bounded systems
- Iterative, dynamic, or time-evolving behavior
- Equilibrium, stability, convergence, or limiting behavior
- Trade-offs between accuracy, complexity, and computational effort

These ideas may appear in abstract, numerical, logical, or system-level forms.  
Participants are **not expected to invoke named theories**, only to reason consistently.

## 3. Algorithmic Execution and Implementation

Where implementation is required, emphasis is placed on:
- Translating models and reasoning into structured, readable procedures or code
- Choosing representations aligned with the nature of the problem
- Managing flow, state, dependencies, and intermediate results cleanly
- Making implementation choices that reflect understanding, not trial-and-error

Clarity of structure and intent is valued alongside correctness.

---

## 4. Reasoning Transparency and Communication

Participants are expected to:
- Make key decisions visible through brief explanations or comments
- Justify modeling choices, assumptions, and simplifications
- Indicate limitations, approximations, or failure modes where relevant

The goal is not verbosity, but **clear communication of thought**.

---

## 5. What This Round Does *Not* Emphasize
- Memorization of domain-specific formulas
- Prior exposure to specialized subjects
- Tool-specific shortcuts or libraries
- Speed-based problem solving

---

## Closing Note

If you are comfortable:
- Reading carefully and structuring problems,
- Building models from first principles,
- Explaining your reasoning clearly,
- Sustaining logical coherence over time,

then you are within scope for Round 2.

All necessary concepts will be introduced as part of the problems themselves.

No specific domain preparation is assumed.\
What matters is how well you reason, structure, and adapt.
